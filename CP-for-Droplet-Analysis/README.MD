Here, we provide a pipeline for CellProfiler (version 3.1.8) to identify and measure the relative fluorescence of droplets in droplet microfluidic assays. We use the default pipeline (Images, Metadata, NamesAndTypes, and Groups) and combined it with the following modules: IdentifyPrimaryObjects, MeasureObjectIntensity, ExportToSpreadsheet, and ExportToDatabase.

Additional notes:
1. The settings suit best with the naming format of our example image data. If you want to use this the pipeline, remember to change the default pipeline and put the setting which suits your format.
2. If you need clear guideline, we have put the full guideline in our supplementary here (see page 5 onwards): http://www.rsc.org/suppdata/d0/ay/d0ay00031k/d0ay00031k1.pdf
